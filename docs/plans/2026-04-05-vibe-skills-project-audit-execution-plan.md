# Vibe-Skills Project Audit Execution Plan

Date: 2026-04-05
Run ID: 20260405-vibe-skills-audit
Internal grade: L
Runtime lane: root_governed

## Scope

Audit the repository for concrete problems by combining:

1. repo and governance artifact inspection
2. core path source review
3. representative verification commands
4. prioritized findings with evidence

## Serial Execution Units

1. Confirm repo identity and current branch state
2. Read user-facing entry surfaces:
   - `README.md`
   - CLI/runtime entrypoints
   - relevant skill/runtime metadata when needed
3. Run representative verification:
   - targeted tests first
   - broader suite only if needed and practical
4. Investigate failures or contract drift in source
5. Produce final review with severity ordering and explicit evidence
6. Emit cleanup receipt

## Ownership Boundaries

- Root lane owns requirement, plan, receipts, and final report
- No child-governed lanes planned for this audit
- No specialist dispatch planned unless a blocking subsystem requires it

## Verification Commands

- `python -B -m pytest -q`
- targeted `python -B -m pytest -q` on failing or representative modules
- source inspection with `sed` / `rg`

## Delivery Acceptance Plan

- Findings must include path references
- At least one executed verification result must appear in the final report
- Architectural concerns without runtime proof must be labeled as risks, not defects

## Completion Language Rules

- "Found" and "observed" only when backed by source or command output
- "Likely" or "inferred" for unexecuted risk analysis
- No no-regression claims

## Rollback Rules

- Review artifacts only
- No code rollback needed unless accidental repo edits occur

## Phase Cleanup Expectations

- Save skeleton receipt
- Save intent contract
- Save cleanup receipt summarizing commands and artifact state
