# Manual Copy Install (Offline / No-Admin)

If you do not want to run the install scripts and only want to place the files manually, remember one thing:

**copy the VibeSkills runtime directories into your target host root.**

This path currently supports only two hosts:

- `codex`
- `claude-code`

If your target is not one of those two, the current version should not be described as supported installation.

## What To Copy

Copy these items into the target host root:

- `skills/`
- `commands/`
- `config/upstream-lock.json`
- `config/skills-lock.json` if it exists in the repo
- the `skills/vibe/` runtime mirror

A simple way to think about them:

- `skills/`: the capabilities themselves
- `commands/`: command entrypoints
- `config/*.json`: lock files and release-alignment metadata
- `skills/vibe/`: the VCO runtime mirror

## Where To Copy Them

Copy them into your target host root.

The target directory should end up containing paths like:

- `<TARGET_ROOT>/skills/`
- `<TARGET_ROOT>/commands/`
- `<TARGET_ROOT>/config/upstream-lock.json`
- `<TARGET_ROOT>/config/skills-lock.json` if present

## What You Still Need To Configure Yourself

Manual copy only places the repo files. It does not finish host-local configuration.

### If you install into Codex

You still need to configure locally:

- `~/.codex/settings.json`
- if you only want Codex base online provider access, commonly `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` under `env`
- if you also want the governance AI online layer, additionally configure:
  - `VCO_AI_PROVIDER_URL`
  - `VCO_AI_PROVIDER_API_KEY`
  - `VCO_AI_PROVIDER_MODEL`

### If you install into Claude Code

You still need to configure locally:

- `~/.claude/settings.json`
- commonly:
  - `VCO_AI_PROVIDER_URL`
  - `VCO_AI_PROVIDER_API_KEY`
  - `VCO_AI_PROVIDER_MODEL`
- and, only if the host connection needs them:
  - `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`
  - `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`

## What This Path Does Not Do Automatically

Manual copy does not automatically complete:

- hook installation
- MCP registration
- provider credential wiring
- edits to Claude Code's real `settings.json`

The important current boundary is:

- `codex` and `claude-code` currently do **not** install hooks
- hook installation is temporarily frozen because of compatibility issues

## Final Boundary

If the governance AI `url` / `apikey` / `model` are not configured locally yet, the environment must not be described as governance-AI-online-ready.

For `codex`, that also means `OPENAI_*` being configured must not be presented as if the governance AI online layer were configured too.

Those values should be filled by the user in local host settings or local environment variables, not pasted into chat.

## When Not To Use This Path

Do not use manual copy if you want:

- AI to choose the correct supported host for you
- the scripts to run install + check automatically
- less host-local configuration work

Use this instead:

- [`one-click-install-release-copy.en.md`](./one-click-install-release-copy.en.md)
