This directory contains the public install, upgrade, and custom-integration docs.

## Public Versions

The public install surface still exposes two user-facing versions:

- `Full Version + Customizable Governance`
- `Framework Only + Customizable Governance`

Their actual script-level profile mapping is:

- `Full Version + Customizable Governance` -> `full`
- `Framework Only + Customizable Governance` -> `minimal`

Keep the public wording user-friendly, then map to the real profile at execution time.

## Publicly Supported Hosts

- `codex`
- `claude-code`
- `cursor`
- `windsurf`

Within that scope:
