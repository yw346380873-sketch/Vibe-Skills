## What Lives Here

This directory stores governed VCO release notes and the minimum runtime-facing navigation needed to cut or verify a release.

## Start Here

Older release notes remain in this directory as historical version records, but they are not part of the active release surface.

## Historical Packetization

- [`wave15-18-release-packet.md`](wave15-18-release-packet.md) - historical packetization artifact, not the current release-note format

## Release Operator Entry

Canonical release cut command:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\governance\release-cut.ps1 -RunGates
```

On Windows, `powershell.exe` remains an acceptable fallback if `pwsh` is unavailable, but the governed cross-platform release command is `pwsh`.

## Stop-Ship Families

Exact script names live in the gate-family index. At the README level, releases should be understood through families rather than giant flat lists:

- topology and integrity: version consistency, version packaging, config parity, nested bundled parity, mirror edit hygiene, BOM/frontmatter integrity
- runtime and install coherence: installed runtime freshness, release/install/runtime coherence
- fallback truth honesty: no silent fallback contract, self-introduced fallback guard, release-truth consistency
- cleanliness and readiness: repo cleanliness, wave board readiness, capability dedup, adaptive routing readiness, upstream value ops

## Extended Release Trains

Use the gate-family index for the exact scripts. The extended trains stay grouped here by governed concern:

- Wave64-82 extensions: memory runtime, browser / desktop / document / connector scorecards, cross-plane replay, ops cockpit, rollback drill, release-train closure
- Exact gates include `vibe-wave64-82-closure-gate.ps1` and `vibe-release-train-v2-gate.ps1`.
- Wave83-100 extensions: gate reliability, eval quality, candidate / role / subagent / discovery governance, capability lifecycle, sandbox simulation, release evidence bundle, bounded rollout, upstream re-audit closure
- Wave83-100 Extended Gates: `vibe-release-evidence-bundle-gate.ps1`, `vibe-manual-apply-policy-gate.ps1`, `vibe-rollout-proposal-boundedness-gate.ps1`, `vibe-upstream-reaudit-matrix-gate.ps1`, `vibe-wave83-100-closure-gate.ps1`

## Rules

- `docs/releases/README.md` is the release-surface navigator, not the flat home for every gate script.
- Keep current release surface, proof handoff, and historical packetization separated instead of flattening them into one list.
- Exact gate names, ordering, and family ownership are defined by [`../../scripts/verify/gate-family-index.md`](../../scripts/verify/gate-family-index.md).
- Degraded closure is never equivalent to authoritative success. If a release depends on fallback or degraded behavior, the release surface must say so explicitly and include fallback-truth consistency proof.
- Release notes stay one-file-per-version using the `v<version>.md` pattern.
- Historical release packets must stay distinct from the current governed release surface.
