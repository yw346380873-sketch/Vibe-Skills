# Closure Audit

Updated: 2026-03-12

## Summary

This audit covers the current closure batch for the non-regression-first cleanup program.

Primary objective:

- make the active repo state simpler and more navigable
- standardize phase-end hygiene
- keep routing, packaging, mirror topology, outputs boundary, and installed runtime behavior non-regressed

## Anti-Drift Closure Contract

This closure surface now uses the same anti-proxy-goal-drift vocabulary as requirement, plan, review, retro, and CER artifacts.

For closure reporting:

- state the primary objective and current completion state honestly,
- record report-only warning codes when wording needed correction,
- distinguish bounded specialization from generalized completion,
- treat anti-drift findings as closure-language governance evidence, not as a hidden hard gate.

## Completed In This Batch

- repaired `phase-end-cleanup.ps1` so it matches the current governance helper contract
- repaired wrapper switch forwarding for Node audit / cleanup scripts
- added a reusable phase-end cleanup operator entrypoint and documented it in governance / verify docs
- aligned `config/index.md` and `references/index.md` to the active 2026-03-11 remediation plan
- refreshed `docs/status/*` to describe the current green proof state rather than earlier failure state
- reclassified `docs/status` supporting baselines into guardrail / proof contract / transitional blocker / dated baseline roles
- removed stale cleanliness-dashboard wording by separating frozen inventory baseline from current gate-backed cleanliness truth
- re-synced canonical changes to the bundled mirror and verified that `nested_bundled` can remain absent under the current topology contract
- re-greened mirror-aware packaging parity after the docs and script updates
- refreshed routing and installed-runtime proof artifacts

## Verified Green Contracts

- `vibe-pack-routing-smoke.ps1`: `PASS`
- `vibe-router-contract-gate.ps1`: `PASS`
- `vibe-version-packaging-gate.ps1`: `PASS`
- `vibe-mirror-edit-hygiene-gate.ps1`: `PASS`
- `vibe-output-artifact-boundary-gate.ps1`: `PASS`
- `vibe-installed-runtime-freshness-gate.ps1`: `PASS`
- `vibe-release-install-runtime-coherence-gate.ps1`: `PASS`
- `vibe-repo-cleanliness-gate.ps1`: `PASS`
- `scripts/governance/phase-end-cleanup.ps1 -WriteArtifacts -IncludeMirrorGates`: `PASS`

## Evidence Anchors

- `outputs/verify/vibe-router-contract-gate.json`
- `outputs/verify/vibe-version-packaging-gate.json`

- `outputs/verify/vibe-nested-bundled-parity-gate.json`
- `outputs/verify/vibe-output-artifact-boundary-gate.json`

- `outputs/runtime/process-health/cleanups/node-process-cleanup-20260312-203003.json`

## Still Not Completed

- the repository is not globally zero-dirty
- `nested_bundled` is still a governed compatibility surface, but it no longer has to remain as a tracked physical payload
- tracked `outputs/**` are still present under `stage2_mirrored`
- `third_party/system-prompts-mirror` and `third_party/vco-ecosystem-mirror` are still protected dependency roots
- the alpha-to-omega cleanup program is not closed

## Misclaims Explicitly Rejected

Do **not** claim any of the following based on this batch:

- “the repo is fully clean”
- “all mirror layers are freely removable now”
- “all outputs can now be deleted”
- “all node zombies were cleaned”
- “the whole remediation program is complete”
- “a report-only anti-drift warning automatically fails closure”

## Honest Conclusion

This batch is a **closure success** for the current operator and documentation slice.

- It means the active status spine is materially cleaner, the supporting baseline layer is materially less drift-prone, phase-end hygiene is standardized, and proof surfaces are green again after the latest edits.
- It does not mean the broader repository simplification program is finished; the remaining work is now a governed backlog rather than random repo noise.

## Next Hop

- current runtime summary: [`current-state.md`](current-state.md)
- latest operator receipt: [`operator-dry-run.md`](operator-dry-run.md)
- active execution plan: [`../plans/2026-03-11-vco-repo-simplification-remediation-plan.md`](../plans/2026-03-11-vco-repo-simplification-remediation-plan.md)
