# Hard Migration Report - Batch E Final Cleanup

Date: 2026-02-24
Mode: hard cleanup (canonical-only runtime routing)

## Objective

- Complete Batch E from audit-only state to final cleanup.
- Remove deprecated alias behavior from runtime routing.
- Keep historical audit artifacts for traceability.

## Changes Applied

1. Canonical-only alias routing
- `skills/vibe/config/skill-alias-map.json`: set `aliases` to `{}` and marked Batch E cleanup complete.
- `skills/vibe/bundled/skills/vibe/config/skill-alias-map.json`: synchronized to canonical-only.

2. Workflow source resolution aligned to canonical-first
- `skills/vibe/install.ps1`: workflow skills resolve from `skills/<name>` first, legacy `superpowers/skills/<name>` as fallback.
- `skills/vibe/install.sh`: same canonical-first behavior.

3. Hard-migration blockers removed
- `skills/spec-kit-vibe-compat/command-map.json`: `code-review3 -> code-review`.
- `skills/security-reviewer/SKILL.md`: removed `code-review3` reference.
- `skills/think-harder/SKILL.md`: removed `code-review3` reference.

4. Verification scripts migrated to canonical requests
- `skills/vibe/scripts/verify/vibe-soft-migration-practice.ps1`: canonical checks (`code-review`, `xlsx`) and `alias_hit = false` assertions.
- `skills/vibe/scripts/verify/vibe-pack-regression-matrix.ps1`: canonical requested-skill scenarios.
- `skills/vibe/scripts/verify/vibe-pack-routing-smoke.ps1`: fixed alias-empty assertion for canonical-only mode.

5. Audit artifacts retained as historical snapshot
- `skills/vibe/config/batch-e-alias-whitelist.json`: added historical status note.
- `skills/vibe/docs/hard-migration-batch-e-alias-whitelist-audit.md`: marked as superseded by this report.

## Verification Results

- `vibe-routing-smoke.ps1`: 38/38 pass
- `vibe-pack-routing-smoke.ps1`: 49/49 pass
- `vibe-skill-index-routing-audit.ps1`: 93/93 pass
- `vibe-keyword-precision-audit.ps1`: 982/982 pass
- `vibe-pack-regression-matrix.ps1`: 24/24 pass
- `vibe-soft-migration-practice.ps1`: 11/11 pass

## Impact Scan (Post-cleanup)

Targeted scan for deprecated runtime identifiers (`code-review3`, `xlsx1`, `superpowers/skills/`) shows:

- Runtime/config/install/verification paths: no active dependency left.
- Remaining references are historical records only:
  - `skills/vibe/config/batch-e-alias-whitelist.json`
  - `skills/vibe/docs/hard-migration-batch-e-alias-whitelist-audit.md`
  - `skills/vibe/references/changelog.md`
  - mirrored bundled copies under `skills/vibe/bundled/skills/vibe/...`

## Directory Cleanup Check

- Confirmed removed duplicates remain absent:
  - `skills/code-review1`
  - `skills/code-review2`
  - `skills/code-review3`
  - `skills/code-review4`
  - `skills/xlsx1`
- Confirmed bundled overlap cleanup remains stable:
  - `skills/vibe/bundled/skills/` contains only `vibe`
  - `skills/vibe/bundled/superpowers-skills/` has no duplicate skill directories

## Conclusion

Batch E final cleanup is complete for runtime behavior:

- Routing now runs in canonical-only mode.
- Main and bundled alias/runtime configs are synchronized.
- Full verification suite passed with no regression.
- Residual deprecated-name strings are preserved only for historical traceability.
