## What Lives Here

This directory stores governed VCO release notes and the minimum runtime-facing navigation needed to cut or verify a release.

## Start Here

### Current Release Surface

- [`v2.3.45.md`](v2.3.45.md): benchmark_autonomous bridge durability hardening, artifact-root-relative runtime summary paths, and restored end-to-end Python bridge proof

### Release Runtime / Proof Handoff

- [`../runtime-freshness-install-sop.md`](../runtime-freshness-install-sop.md): install, freshness, and coherence SOP
- [`../../scripts/verify/gate-family-index.md`](../../scripts/verify/gate-family-index.md): gate family navigation and typical run order
- [`../../scripts/verify/README.md`](../../scripts/verify/README.md): verify surface entrypoint
- [`../status/non-regression-proof-bundle.md`](../status/non-regression-proof-bundle.md): minimum closure proof contract

Older release notes remain in this directory as historical version records, but they are not part of the active release surface.

## Historical Packetization

- [`wave15-18-release-packet.md`](wave15-18-release-packet.md) - historical packetization artifact, not the current release-note format

## Release Operator Entry

Canonical release cut command:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\governance\release-cut.ps1 -RunGates
```

On Windows, `powershell.exe` remains an acceptable fallback if `pwsh` is unavailable, but the governed cross-platform release command is `pwsh`.

## Stop-Ship Families

Exact script names live in the gate-family index. At the README level, releases should be understood through families rather than giant flat lists:

- topology and integrity: version consistency, version packaging, config parity, nested bundled parity, mirror edit hygiene, BOM/frontmatter integrity
- runtime and install coherence: installed runtime freshness, release/install/runtime coherence
- cleanliness and readiness: repo cleanliness, wave board readiness, capability dedup, adaptive routing readiness, upstream value ops

## Extended Release Trains

Use the gate-family index for the exact scripts. The extended trains stay grouped here by governed concern:

- Wave64-82 extensions: memory runtime, browser / desktop / document / connector scorecards, cross-plane replay, ops cockpit, rollback drill, release-train closure
- Wave83-100 extensions: gate reliability, eval quality, candidate / role / subagent / discovery governance, capability lifecycle, sandbox simulation, release evidence bundle, bounded rollout, upstream re-audit closure

## Rules

- `docs/releases/README.md` is the release-surface navigator, not the flat home for every gate script.
- Keep current release surface, proof handoff, and historical packetization separated instead of flattening them into one list.
- Exact gate names, ordering, and family ownership are defined by [`../../scripts/verify/gate-family-index.md`](../../scripts/verify/gate-family-index.md).
- Release notes stay one-file-per-version using the `v<version>.md` pattern.
- Historical release packets must stay distinct from the current governed release surface.
