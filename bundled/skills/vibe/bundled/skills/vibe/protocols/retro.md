# vibe-retro Protocol

Protocol for structured retrospective -- collaborative analysis of recent projects,
workflow optimization, error pattern detection, context diagnosis, and future improvement planning.

## Scope
Activated when the user wants to:
- Review and reflect on recent project work
- Identify workflow optimization opportunities
- Detect recurring error patterns and design preventive hooks
- Diagnose context quality failures in long-running tasks
- Discover reusable patterns for future projects
- Decide whether to create new skills, agents, MCPs, or hooks
- Conduct a collaborative improvement discussion

## Context Retro Advisor (Agent-Skills Guided)

VCO uses Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering as an expert advisor in retro mode.
This advisor is guidance-only and never auto-mutates runtime configuration.

### Knowledge Sources (preferred)
- context-fundamentals
- context-degradation
- context-compression
- context-optimization
- multi-agent-patterns
- memory-systems
- tool-design
- filesystem-context
- evaluation
- advanced-evaluation
- project-development

### Advisory Boundaries
- The advisor can classify failure modes and recommend interventions.
- The advisor cannot directly change router thresholds, pack manifest, or conflict rules.
- Any config or policy change still requires explicit user approval in Phase 4.

### Fallback if Skills Are Missing
- Fall back to built-in VCO heuristics in this protocol.
- Continue with evidence-backed diagnosis using available session/tool data.

## 5-Phase Architecture

Phase 1: GATHER -> Phase 2: ANALYZE -> Phase 3: DISCUSS -> Phase 4: DECIDE -> Phase 5: ACT

Each phase uses existing tools from the integrated plugins.

---

## Phase 1: GATHER (Data Collection)

### 1.1 Conversation History Retrieval
Tool: Cognee graph retrieval (optional) + session file scan
- Query long-term relationship graph for target project/topic context (if Cognee available)
- Read recent session files for short-horizon execution trace
- Fallback: session files only (do not use episodic-memory in VCO governance mode)

### 1.2 Session Activity Review
Tool: Read ~/.claude/sessions/ files
- Read recent session files
- Extract: tasks performed, files modified, tools used

### 1.3 Instinct Status Check
Tool: everything-claude-code:instinct-status
- Show learned instincts grouped by domain
- Check confidence scores and recent updates
- Fallback: Skip if instinct system not active

### 1.4 Project Memory Retrieval
Tool: Serena MCP list_memories + read_memory
- List project-related memories
- Read key decisions, architecture notes
- Fallback: Skip if Serena not available

### 1.5 Error Log Collection
Tool: git log + session/ruflo trace synthesis
- git log --oneline -20 (recent commits, especially fix/revert)
- Search session traces/ruflo memory for error, fix, bug, revert

### 1.6 Context Signal Collection
Tool: session/tool trace synthesis
- Count retries, fallback frequency, and compaction events
- Measure large-output tool calls and repeated low-value observations
- Detect route instability (same intent, different route outcomes)

#### Default Trigger Thresholds

Use these defaults unless project policy defines stricter thresholds:

| Signal | Metric | Default Threshold | Trigger Meaning |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Retry spike | `retry_count_10m` | `>= 3` | Execution stuck in retry loop |
| Fallback frequency | `fallback_rate` | `>= 0.20` | Primary path reliability degraded |
| Context pressure | `context_pressure` | `>= 0.75` | Context budget at risk |
| Route instability (pack) | `route_stability_pack` | `< 0.80` | Same intent routes to different packs |
| Route instability (skill) | `route_stability_skill` | `< 0.70` | Skill selection jitter inside pack |
| Route ambiguity | `top1_top2_gap` | `< 0.03` | Weak route separability |

Where:
- `fallback_rate = fallback_count / total_attempts`
- `context_pressure = observation_chars_total / context_budget_chars`
- `route_stability_pack = most_common_pack / total_probe_runs`
- `route_stability_skill = most_common_skill / total_probe_runs`

Present structured data collection report before proceeding.

## Phase 2: ANALYZE (Structured Analysis)

### 2.1 Session Reflection
Tool: claude-code-settings:reflection-harder (or everything-claude-code:deep-reflector agent)
Fallback: claude-code-settings:think-harder
- Analyze recent sessions for problems solved, patterns established

### 2.2 Problem Pattern Detection
Tool: hookify:conversation-analyzer agent
Fallback: Manual scan of session traces and commit history
- Scan for user frustration signals, repeated errors, tool misuse
- Severity categorization (high/medium/low)

### 2.3 Workflow Frequency Analysis
Tool: Analyze session files + ruflo short-term memory
- Most frequently used tool combinations
- Repeated multi-step workflows (automation candidates)

### 2.4 Cross-Session Trend Analysis
Tool: claude-code-settings:think-ultra (7-phase analysis), or think-harder (4-phase) for M grade
Fallback: Direct Claude reasoning synthesis
- Synthesize data from 2.1-2.3
- Error trends, activity domains, time sinks

### 2.5 Context Failure Typing (Context Retro Advisor)
Classify failures into one or more classes:
- CF-1 Attention dilution / lost-in-middle
- CF-2 Context poisoning (stale or contradictory state)
- CF-3 Observation bloat (tool outputs dominate useful tokens)
- CF-4 Memory mismatch (retrieval irrelevant/missing)
- CF-5 Tool contract ambiguity (tool schema/intent mismatch)
- CF-6 Evaluation blind spot (no rubric, weak verification)

### 2.6 Intervention Design
Map each failure class to interventions:
- Compaction strategy update (what to compress, when)
- Observation masking rules (what to retain vs reference)
- Context partitioning for XL tasks (agent boundary refinement)
- Memory indexing/persistence policy adjustments
- Evaluation rubric and verification gate hardening

---

## Phase 3: DISCUSS (Interactive Discussion)

### Interaction Style: Pedagogical Advisory

**Proactive Engagement:**
- Actively identify improvement opportunities
- Use guiding questions to surface insights
- For each finding, provide concrete improvement path

**Data-Grounded Suggestions:**
- Every suggestion references specific evidence from Phase 2
- When uncertain, acknowledge uncertainty explicitly

**Discussion Topics:**
- Workflow review: automation candidates, efficiency improvements
- Error prevention: hooks, pre-commit checks
- Context quality: compression policy, masking policy, partitioning strategy
- Tool effectiveness: routing accuracy, fallback frequency
- Future planning: templates, skills, new tools

**Respectful Autonomy:**
- User makes all final decisions
- Explicitly ask for confirmation before Phase 4

---

## Phase 4: DECIDE (Decisions)

### Decision Categories

| Category | Action Type | Tool |
|----------|------------|------|
| Recurring workflow | Create skill | superpowers:writing-skills |
| Recurring workflow | Create command | claude-code-settings:command-creator |

- include: failure classes, key interventions, guardrails, confidence

Optionally keep full JSON in local artifact store for trend analytics.

### 5.8 Update Context Playbook (Optional)
Update docs/context-retro-advisor-design.md if policy-level changes are accepted.

### 5.9 Run Retro Regression Checks (Optional but recommended)
Tool: `scripts/verify/vibe-retro-context-regression-matrix.ps1`
- Validate trigger threshold logic with fixed metric cases
- Validate CF-1..CF-6 classification stability with bilingual fixed evidence cases

### 5.10 Compare CER Across Iterations (Optional but recommended)
Tool: `scripts/verify/cer-compare.ps1`
- Compare baseline and current CER JSON reports
- Output machine-readable and human-readable delta summaries
- Track trend fields: pattern delta, fallback_rate delta, stability delta, context_pressure delta

---

## Context Evidence Report (CER) Output Contract

Every Context Retro Advisor analysis MUST output this schema:

1. Pattern: failure class tags (CF-1..CF-6)
2. Evidence: concrete observations (commands, outputs, events)
3. Root Cause: why the pattern occurred
4. Intervention: concrete change proposal
5. Guardrail: validation check preventing recurrence
6. Confidence: high/medium/low with scope limits

No recommendation should be emitted without Evidence.

### CER JSON Validation
- Validate generated JSON against `templates/cer-report.schema.json` when available.
- If schema validation fails, mark report status as `invalid` and do not use it for trend comparison.

## Grade Adaptation

| Grade | Scope | Phases Used | Depth |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------|
| M | Single project retro | 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 | Full analysis, selective action |
| L | Multi-project retro | All 5 phases | Full analysis + implementation |
| XL | System-wide retro | All 5 + parallel agents | Deep analysis + major changes |

## Conflict Avoidance
- Phase 2 analysis agents run sequentially to avoid mutual exclusion.
- Exception: XL grade uses Codex native team for parallel analysis.
- hookify conversation-analyzer is an analysis tool -- safe at any grade.
- deep-reflector is a diagnostic agent -- exempt from Rule 1.
- Context Retro Advisor is advisory and can run at any grade.
- Phase 5 actions are sequential: hooks first, then skills, then config.
- Router or threshold changes require explicit user confirmation.
