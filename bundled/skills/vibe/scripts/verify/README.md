- `..\governance\set-openspec-rollout.ps1`: stage switch helper for `off | shadow | soft-lxl-planning | strict-lxl-planning`.
- `..\governance\publish-openspec-soft-rollout.ps1`: single-command soft rollout with precheck -> switch -> postcheck. Automatic rollback is disabled; failures emit manual rollback command and require explicit user confirmation.

## Quick Start (Retro Checks)

Run context retro smoke + deterministic matrix:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-context-retro-smoke.ps1"
& ".\vibe-retro-context-regression-matrix.ps1"
& ".\vibe-retro-safety-gate.ps1"
```

## Quick Start (Routing Stability Gate)

Run default gate (recommended first pass):

```powershell
& ".\vibe-routing-stability-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
```

Run strict gate (after default gate is passing consistently):

```powershell
& ".\vibe-routing-stability-gate.ps1" -Strict -WriteArtifacts
```

Run config parity gate (main vs bundled):

```powershell
& ".\vibe-config-parity-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
```

Run OpenSpec governance gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-openspec-governance-gate.ps1"
```

Run GSD overlay trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-gsd-overlay-gate.ps1"
```

Run Prompt overlay trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-prompt-overlay-gate.ps1"
```

Run Memory governance trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-memory-governance-gate.ps1"
```

Run Data scale overlay trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-data-scale-overlay-gate.ps1"
```

Run Quality debt overlay trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-quality-debt-overlay-gate.ps1"
```

Run Framework interop overlay trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-framework-interop-gate.ps1"
```

Run ML lifecycle overlay trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-ml-lifecycle-overlay-gate.ps1"
```

Run Python clean-code overlay trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-python-clean-code-overlay-gate.ps1"
```

Run System design overlay trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-system-design-overlay-gate.ps1"
```

Run CUDA kernel overlay trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-cuda-kernel-overlay-gate.ps1"
```

Run observability gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-observability-gate.ps1"
```

Keep generated fixture files for manual inspection:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-data-scale-overlay-gate.ps1" -KeepFixtures
```

Compare two CER reports and emit delta artifacts:

```powershell
& ".\cer-compare.ps1" `
  -BaselineCerPath "..\..\outputs\retro\cer\baseline.json" `
  -CurrentCerPath "..\..\outputs\retro\cer\current.json" `
  -OutputMarkdownPath "..\..\outputs\retro\compare\delta.md" `
  -OutputJsonPath "..\..\outputs\retro\compare\delta.json" `
  -UpdateCurrentComparison
```

Interpretation:
- `fallback_rate` delta < 0 is better.
- `stability` delta > 0 is better.
- `context_pressure` delta < 0 is better.
- `route_gap` delta > 0 usually means better route separability.

## External Corpus Gate

Build candidate suggestions from external prompt corpus and evaluate them safely:

```powershell
& "..\research\extract-prompt-signals.ps1" `
  -SourceRoot "..\..\third_party\system-prompts-mirror" `
  -OutputPath "..\..\outputs\external-corpus\prompt-signals.json"

& "..\research\generate-vco-suggestions.ps1" `
  -SignalPath "..\..\outputs\external-corpus\prompt-signals.json" `
  -SourceRoot "..\..\third_party\system-prompts-mirror" `
  -OutputDirectory "..\..\outputs\external-corpus"

& ".\vibe-external-corpus-gate.ps1" `
  -CandidateSkillIndexPath "..\..\outputs\external-corpus\skill-keyword-index.candidate.json" `
  -RunExistingSmoke
```

For strict CI mode (smoke errors block merge):

```powershell
& ".\vibe-external-corpus-gate.ps1" `
  -CandidateSkillIndexPath "..\..\outputs\external-corpus\skill-keyword-index.candidate.json" `
  -RunExistingSmoke `
  -FailOnSmokeError
```

Output artifacts:
- `outputs/external-corpus/prompt-signals.json`
- `outputs/external-corpus/vco-suggestions.json`
- `outputs/external-corpus/vco-suggestions.md`
- `outputs/external-corpus/skill-keyword-index.candidate.json`
- `outputs/external-corpus/external-corpus-gate.json`
- `outputs/external-corpus/external-corpus-gate.md`

Build environment/user-profile-aware threshold suggestions from telemetry (manual apply only):

```powershell
& "..\learn\vibe-adaptive-train.ps1" -LookbackDays 7
```

Output artifacts:
- `outputs/learn/vibe-adaptive-suggestions.json`
- `outputs/learn/vibe-adaptive-suggestions.md`
